# The contents of this file are added to the contents of `pyproject.toml`, which was generated by
# a call to `uv init`. We augment `pyproject.toml` rather than simply overwrite it, as we want to
# leverage updates to `uv init` as they are made available in the future; this wouldn't be possible
# (without a lot of manual effort in this template) if we overwrote the file.
